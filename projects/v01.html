              <p>
                Since I did so many lost property, I would like to make lost property prevention attachment, which can let us know by beeping if we leave the property without taking as below.<br>
                <br>
                I want the attachment to connect the application of smartphone via <code>bluetooth</code> or <code>iBeacon</code>. The application operate on the background of the smartphone, and beeping if the smartphone gets apart from the attachment to a certain distane (eg. 5m, 10, or so).

                I would like to make "remote lock attachment".<br>
                <br>
                I often forget to lock my door when I go out from my flat, and every time have to return to lock. In addition to that, there are times when I cannote lock the door having baggages with both my hands. I have been wishing I could lock the door of my flat from a distance after I leave my house.<br>
                <br>
                Though automatic lock is existing, there are cases when it is too expensive for students living single or implementing it is impossible physically. <br>

                <br>
                From the reaon as I mentioned above, I would like to make "remote lock attachment", which can implement doors easily and can lock the door from a distance with browse apps on smartphone as following image.<br>
