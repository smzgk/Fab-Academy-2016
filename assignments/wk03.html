            <h3>1. laser Cutter & Vinyl Cutter</h3>
            <hr/>
            <div class="lead">
              <p>
                This week, Professor Niel introduced us Computer-controlled cutting, and two tools for that; laser Cutter and Vinyl Cutter.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>laser Cutter</strong></p>
              <p>
                A laser cutter was typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated.<br>
                <br>
                THere are wide range of ways of its use, as below;
                <ul>
                  <li>marking, engraving</li>
                  <li>screen printing</li>
                  <li>press-fit construction</li>
                  <li>flexures, living hinges, mechanisms</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p><strong>Vinyl Cutter</strong></p>
              <p>
                A vinyl cutter is a type of computer controlled machine. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).<br>
                <br>
                There are a range of ways of Vinyl Cutter, which can make;
                <ul>
                  <li>stickers</li>
                  <li>flexible circuit boards</li>
                  <li>a textured surface/relief pattern</li>
                  <li>screenprint resists/stencils</li>
                </ul>

            <hr/>
            <div class="lead">
              <p>
                I wanted to make something, which I needed and could use as usual, because I did not want to make just a trash. I decided to make "Pen Stand" since I have just moved to Amsterdam and there are few facilities in my flat.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Making  3D model</strong></p>
              <p>
                First, I made 3D model of Pen Stand, using Fusion 360. Due to the learning last week, making model itself was very easy and took me only 10 minutes.

              <p><strong>Making Cutting Blueprint</strong></p>
              <p>
                Next, I had to make blueprint to cut cardboards, and used <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/make" target="_blank">Autodesk 123D Make</a>, which can turn 3D models into 2D build plans with animated assembly instructions. Thanks to it, I was able to make 2D build plan within only 10-20 minutes, and the preparation for cutting was finished with modification on Inkscape.<br>
                <div class="screenshot">

              <p><strong>Cutting... and Mistake!</strong></p>
              <p>
                Though I thougt what waited for me next was only cutting, I made several mistakes as below...;
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Incorrect setting on laser power/speed</strong>
                  <p>
                    Before using laser cutter, we have to set laser <code>speed</code>, <code>power</code> and <code>corner power</code>, and the parameters are different from material to material. It is neccesary for me to set appropriate parameters for <code>Cardboard 3mm</code>, which is the material assigned this week.<br>
                    <br>
                    <code>Speed</code> indicates how fast the extruder moves. If speed is too fast, the material cannot be cut enough, and if too slow, it takes too much time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <code>Power</code> and <code>corner power</code> indicates the strongness of laser. If power is too strong, the material might be fired and melted, and if too weak, they cannot be cut neetly.
                    <div class="small_image">
                      <img src="../img/wk03/wk03_04_miscut.png" height="648" width="442">
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-center">Weak power made inadequate cut</p>                    
                    <br>
                    In my first trial, I set wrong parameter to laser cutter, so the cardboards could not be cut clearly, and I had to examine several parameter. As a result of these trial, I fuond the moderate parameter for cardboards 3mm as table below.<br> 
                    <br>
                    <table class="table">
                      <thead>
                        <th></th>
                        <th><code>speed</code></th>
                        <th><code>power</code></th>
                        <th><code>corner power</code></th>
                      </thead>
                      <tr>
                        <th>cut</th>
                        <td>100</td>
                        <td>70</td>
                        <td>40</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <th>engrave</th>
                        <td>200</td>
                        <td>20</td>
                        <td>10</td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>
                    <br>
                    However, the parameter changes due to the cleanliness of laser extruder or other emviroments, so it is vital to test the parameter before cutting production output.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wrong thickness of joint parts</strong>
                  <p>
                    Second problem was wrong thickness of joint points. In my first trial, I set the thickness of joint points 3mm, however, it made the model too looth to make up. Sadly, I could not make up them at all... 
                  </p>
                  <div class="screenshot">
                    <img src="../img/wk03/wk03_05_misbuild.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-center">Too looth to joint and construct....</p>
                  Then I made test joint parts, and tried width of joint points: 2.6mm~3.0mm as pictures below. and found that appropriate width of joint points in 2D model plan is <u>2.6-2.7mm</u> for cardboard 3mm.

              </ul>
              <br>

              <p><strong>Cutting and construction</strong></p>
              <p>
                After several trial and error, I was successfully able to make 2D cutting buleprint as below;

                <div class="screenshot">
                  <img src="../img/wk03/wk03_03_blueprint.png">

                <br>

                Then finally, I cut the cardboard successfully, and comlete making up the cardboard pen stand. Though it is simple one, I have done trials and errors, and struggling, so I felt really happy to make my first "real" production.

            <h3>3. Practice(2) - Handmade Sticker - </h3>
            <hr/>
            <div class="lead">
              <p>
                Next assignments for this week is using vinyl cutter, and I decided to make sticker for my notebook, which was unfashionable one with only logo of Salesforce Ltd.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Making 2D cuttng plan</strong></p>
              <p>
                I used simply Inkscape to draw the plan. First, I convert image which was logo of Waag Society (Fablab Amsterdam) from Raster to Vector, and added some scriptions. <br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <div class="small_image">
                <img src="../img/wk03/wk03_09_sticker01.png" height="316" width="314">
              </div>
              <p class="text-center">Sticker Design<p>                

              <br>
              Also, there are several points which we have to pay attention to on this process as below;             

              <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                <h4>1. Convert Strokes to Paths</h4>
                <p>After finishied drawing, <code>Strokes</code> have to be converted to <code>Paths</code>, so that we can prevent the outlines of output objects being double lines. If Strokes are left as it is, the outlines of sticker will be duoble lines after cutting by Vinyl Cutter.</p>
                <h4>2. Joint Paths</h4>
                <p>Don't forget joint paths with each otehr. Vinyl Cutter traces not Strokes but Paths of Raster Image, so if paths are not jointed, the outline of sticker will be not straight and consecutive but apart with each other, which cannot be used as sticker... </p>
              </div>

              <div class="small_image">

              <br>
              After several trials and errors, I could successfully cut the sheet, then use transparent sticker to paste it on my notebook. Making process itself was really simple and easy if people pay attention to several important points as above, and it was exciting experience.
